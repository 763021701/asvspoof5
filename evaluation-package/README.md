# ASVspoof5 Evaluation Package
We provide this evaluation package to compute the evaluation metrics for both Phase 1 and Phase 2.

Track 1
* min DCF (primary)
* CLLR, EER (secondary)

Track 2
* a-tdcf (primary)
* min t-DCF and t-EER (secondary)


## Usage
For the Track 1, cm score 

1. Track 1
Calucate minDCF, CLLR, and EER by giving one cm score file
```
python evaluation.py -m p1 -cm cm_score_file
```

2. Track 2
Calucate a-DCF, min t-DCF, and t-EER by giving cm score file (and asv score file for min t-DCF and t-EER)
To compute a-DCF, `pip install a_dcf` will install the package.
For further details, please check [([Github](https://github.com/shimhz/a_DCF))].
```
# To calculate all metrics, 
python evaluation.py -m p2_tandem -cm cm_score_file -asv asv_score_file

# To calculate a-DCF only, 
python evaluation.py -m p2_single -cm cm_score_file
```

### Score file format
- The score file format should include four columns:
  - (i) speaker model, (ii) test utterance, (iii) score, and (iv) trial type
- Example of score file
```
# CM score file (for minDCF, CLLR, EER, and a-DCF)
# <speaker_id> <utterance_id> <score> <trial type> 
LA_0015 LA_E_1103494 6.960134565830231 bonafide
LA_0007 LA_E_5013670 6.150891035795212 bonafide
LA_0007 LA_E_7417804 -2.306972861289978 spoof

# ASV score file (for min t-DCF and t-EER)
# <cm_label> <sasv_label> <score>
bonafide target 36.78691
bonafide nontarget -39.15536
A01 spoof 27.07672
